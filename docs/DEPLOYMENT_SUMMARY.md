3. **Deploy**: Update ECS services with new images
4. **Validate**: Check health endpoints and metrics
5. **Rollback**: Automatic rollback on deployment failures

### Scaling Operations
```bash
# Scale up manually
aws ecs update-service --cluster counselor-prod --service counselor-prod-backend --desired-count 5

# Scale down during maintenance
aws ecs update-service --cluster counselor-prod --service counselor-prod-backend --desired-count 1
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Create database snapshot
aws rds create-db-snapshot --db-instance-identifier counselor-prod-db --db-snapshot-identifier manual-snapshot-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Monitor database performance
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier counselor-prod-db
